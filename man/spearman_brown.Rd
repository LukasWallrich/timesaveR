}
\usage{
spearman_brown(df, items, name = "", SB_only = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe}

\item{items}{Character vector of length 2, with names of the two items}

\item{name}{Name of the scale, relevant only if data.frame is returned}

\item{SB_only}{Logical, indicating whether to return only the reliabity as
a number or a dataframe that also includes the scale name and correlation.}
}
\value{
Either the Spearman-Brown coefficient as a single number, or a
  dataframe including the Pearson correlation coefficient and the scale name
}
\description{
This function calculates the Spearman-Brown reliability for a two-item scale,
which is the recommended measure for two-item scales (rather than Cronbach's
alpha, which is used for longer scales.)
