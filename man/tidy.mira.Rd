\title{Tidy  multiple imputation models created with `mice`}
\usage{
\method{tidy}{mira}(x, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `mira` object containing multiple models based on `mice` imputations.}

\item{conf.int}{Logical. Should confidence intervals be returned. Defaults to true.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for intervals. Defaults to .95}

\item{...}{extra arguments (not used)}
}
\description{
Note that the `mice` authors prefer to tidy `mipo` rather than `mira` objects and have now included `tidy.mipo` and `glance.mipo` into their package. The `mira` functions here are mostly retained for compatibility with my earlier code.
