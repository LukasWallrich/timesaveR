\title{Get letters to indicate results of multiple comparisons/post-hoc tests}
\source{
Algorithm based on https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/1061860043515
}
\usage{
get_pairwise_letters(tests, alpha_level = 0.05, p.adjust.method = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{tests}{Either a tibble with the result of comparisons, including x and y
(the levels/groups that were compared) and p_value for the comparison or an object
of class pairwise.htest, for example returned from pairwise.t.test()}

\item{alpha_level}{The level of significance for the test}

\item{p.adjust.method}{One of p.adjust.methods, defaults to none as p-values will
typically have been adjusted when carrying out the pairwise comparisons/post-hoc tests}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns that indicate which letter has been assigned to each
group/level
}
\description{
This takes the results of multiple comparisons and returns a set of letters
that can be used to indicate which differences are significant. The difference
between levels that are assigned the same letter are *not* statistically different.
}
\examples{
attach(airquality)
month <- factor(Month, labels = month.abb[5:9])
x <- pairwise.t.test(Ozone, Month)
library(rNuggets)
get_pairwise_letters(x)
detach()
}
