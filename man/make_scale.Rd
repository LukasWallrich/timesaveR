make_scale(
  df,
  scale_items,
  scale_name,
  reverse = c("auto", "none", "spec"),
  reverse_items = NULL,
  two_items_reliability = c("spearman_brown", "cron_alpha", "r"),

}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe}

\item{scale_items}{Character vector with names of scale items (variables in df)}

\item{scale_name}{Name of the scale}

\item{reverse}{Should scale items be reverse coded? One of "auto" - items are
reversed if that contributes to scale consistency, "none" - no items reversed,
or "spec" - items specific in \code{reverse_items} are reversed.}

\item{reverse_items}{Character vector with names of scale items to be reversed
(must be subset of scale_items)}

\item{two_items_reliability}{How should the reliability of two-item scales be
reported? "spearman_brown" is the recommended default, but "cronbachs_alpha"
and Pearson's "r" are also supported.}

\item{r_key}{(optional) Numeric. Set to the possible maximum value of the scale
if the whole scale should be reversed, or to -1 to reverse the scale based on
the observed maximum.}

\item{print_hist}{Logical. Should histograms for items and resulting scale be printed?}

\item{print_desc}{Logical. Should descriptives for scales be printed?}

\item{return_list}{Logical. Should only scale values be returned, or descriptives as well?}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{return_list} argument. Either just the scale values,
  or a list of scale values and descriptives.
}
\description{
This function creates a scale by calculating the mean of a set of items,
and prints and returns descriptives that allow to assess internal consistency
and spread. It is primarily based on the \code{psych::alpha} function, with
more parsimonious output and some added functionality.
