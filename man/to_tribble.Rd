to_tribble(x, show = FALSE, digits = 5)
}
\arguments{

\description{
Tribbles are an easy way to legibly input data, and therefore helpful for teaching
and interactive work. This function takes
a tibble and returns code that can recreate it. Note that this function converts
"NA" to NA and converts factors to characters to retain the levels.
}
\examples{
to_tribble(mtcars, show = TRUE)
}
