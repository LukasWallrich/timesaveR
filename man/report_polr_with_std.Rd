\title{Create a summary table comparing standardized and non-standardized
proportional odd logistic regression models}
\usage{
report_polr_with_std(
  mod,
  mod_std,
  OR = TRUE,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  fmt = "\%.2f",
  statistic_vertical = FALSE,
  filename = NULL,
  model_names = NULL,
  show_nimp = FALSE,
  notes = list(),
  apa_style = TRUE,
  stars = std_stars_pad,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A polr-model/mira object of polr models, with variables not standardized (or a list of such models)}

\item{mod_std}{A polr-model/mira object of polr models, with standardized predictor variables (or a list of such models)}

\item{OR}{Logical. Should odds ratios be shown instead of typical coefficients. If TRUE, estimates are exponentiated}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level to use for confidence intervals, defaults to .95}

\item{fmt}{determines how to format numeric values
\itemize{
\item integer: the number of digits to keep after the period \code{format(round(x, fmt), nsmall=fmt)}
\item character: passed to the \code{sprintf} function (e.g., '\%.3f' keeps 3 digits with trailing zero). See \code{?sprintf}
\item function: returns a formatted character string.
\item Note on LaTeX formatting: To ensure proper typography, all numeric entries are enclosed in the \verb{\\num{}} command from the \code{siunitx} LaTeX package by default. This behavior can be altered with global options. See the 'Details' section.
}}

\item{statistic_vertical}{Should standard errors and CIs be shown below coefficients? Defaults to horizontal layout}

\item{filename}{the file name to create on disk. Include '.html' extension to best preserve formatting (see gt::gtsave for details)}

\item{model_names}{If several pairs of models are to be plotted side by side, indicate the label for each *pair* here}

\item{show_nimp}{Logical. If mira objects are passed, this determines whether the number of imputations will be reported as a model statistic}

\item{notes}{List of notes to append to bottom of table. An explanation of significance stars is automatically added. A note is also added
stating that dummy variables were not scaled in standardization. If you approached standardisation differently, that should be removed.}

\item{apa_style}{Logical, should APA-style formatting be applied}

\item{stars}{Named vector of significance stars and their thresholds, check `timesaveR:::std_stars_pad` for default.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[modelsummary:modelsummary]{modelsummary::modelsummary}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{output}}{filename or object type (character string)
\itemize{
\item Supported filename extensions: .html, .tex, .md, .txt, .png, .jpg.
\item Supported object types: "default", "html", "markdown", "latex", "latex_tabular", "data.frame", "modelsummary_list", "gt", "kableExtra", "huxtable", "flextable", "jupyter".
\item Warning: Users should not supply a file name to the \code{output} argument if they intend to customize the table with external packages. See the 'Details' section.
\item LaTeX compilation requires the \code{booktabs} and \code{siunitx} packages, but \code{siunitx} can be disabled or replaced with global options. See the 'Details' section.
\item The default output formats and table-making packages can be modified with global options. See the 'Details' section.
}}
    \item{\code{estimate}}{string or \code{glue} string of the estimate to display (or a
vector with one string per model). Valid entries include any column name of
the data.frame produced by \code{get_estimates(model)}. Examples:
\itemize{
\item \code{"estimate"}
\item \code{"{estimate} ({std.error}){stars}"}
\item \code{"{estimate} [{conf.low}, {conf.high}]"}
}}
    \item{\code{vcov}}{robust standard errors and other manual statistics. The \code{vcov}
argument accepts six types of input (see the 'Details' and 'Examples'
sections below):
\itemize{
\item NULL returns the default uncertainty estimates of the model object
\item string, vector, or (named) list of strings. Omitting or specifying \code{vcov = NULL} will return the model's default uncertainty estimates, e.g. IID errors for standard models. Alternatively, use the string "iid" (aliases: "classical" or "constant") to present IID errors explicitly. The strings "HC", "HC0", "HC1" (alias: "stata"), "HC2", "HC3" (alias: "robust"), "HC4", "HC4m", "HC5", "HAC", "NeweyWest", "Andrews", "panel-corrected", "outer-product", and "weave" use variance-covariance matrices computed using functions from the \code{sandwich} package, or equivalent method. The behavior of those functions can (and sometimes \emph{must}) be altered by passing arguments to \code{sandwich} directly from \code{modelsummary} through the ellipsis (\code{...}), but it is safer to define your own custom functions as described in the next bullet.
\item function or (named) list of functions which return variance-covariance matrices with row and column names equal to the names of your coefficient estimates (e.g., \code{stats::vcov}, \code{sandwich::vcovHC}, \code{function(x) vcovPC(x, cluster="country")}).
\item formula or (named) list of formulas with the cluster variable(s) on the right-hand side (e.g., ~clusterid).
\item (named) list of \code{length(models)} variance-covariance matrices with row and column names equal to the names of your coefficient estimates.
\item a (named) list of length(models) vectors with names equal to the names of your coefficient estimates. See 'Examples' section below. Warning: since this list of vectors can include arbitrary strings or numbers, \code{modelsummary} cannot automatically calculate p values. The \code{stars} argument may thus use incorrect significance thresholds when \code{vcov} is a list of vectors.
}}
    \item{\code{coef_map}}{character vector. Subset, rename, and reorder coefficients.
Coefficients omitted from this vector are omitted from the table. The order
of the vector determines the order of the table.  \code{coef_map} can be a named
or an unnamed character vector (see the Examples section below). If
\code{coef_map} is a named vector, its values define the labels that must appear
in the table, and its names identify the original term names stored in the
model object: \code{c("hp:mpg"="HPxM/G")}.}
    \item{\code{coef_omit}}{string regular expression. Omits all matching coefficients
from the table using \code{grepl(perl=TRUE)}. This argument uses perl-compatible regular expressions, which allows expressions such as \verb{"Int|ABC" which omits coefficients matching either "Int" or "ABC", and }"^(?!.*Intercept)"` which omits every term except the intercept.}
    \item{\code{coef_rename}}{named character vector or function which returns a named
vector. Values of the vector refer to the variable names that will appear
in the table. Names refer to the original term names stored in the model
object, e.g. c("hp:mpg"="hp X mpg") for an interaction term.}
    \item{\code{gof_map}}{rename, reorder, and omit goodness-of-fit statistics and other
model information. This argument accepts 3 types of values:
\itemize{
\item NULL (default): the \code{modelsummary::gof_map} dictionary is used for formatting, and all unknown statistic are included.
\item data.frame with 3 columns named "raw", "clean", "fmt". Unknown statistics are omitted. See the 'Examples' section below.
\item list of lists, each of which includes 3 elements named "raw", "clean", "fmt". Unknown statistics are omitted. See the 'Examples section below'.
}}
    \item{\code{gof_omit}}{string regular expression. Omits all matching gof statistics from
the table. This argument uses perl-compatible regular expressions (\code{grepl(perl=TRUE)}), which allows expressions such as \code{".*"} which omits everything, and \code{"^(?!R2|Num)"} which omits every term except those that start with "R2" or "Num".}
    \item{\code{group}}{a two-sided formula with two or three components which describes
how groups of parameters should be displayed. The formula must include both
a "term" and a "model" component. In addition, a component can be used to
identify groups of parameters (e.g., outcome levels of a multinomial logit
model). This group identifier must be the name of a column in the
data.frame produced by \code{get_estimates(model)}.
\itemize{
\item \code{term ~ model} displays coefficients as rows and models as columns
\item \code{model ~ term} displays models as rows and coefficients as columns
\item \code{response + term ~ model} displays response levels and coefficients as rows and models as columns.
}}
    \item{\code{group_map}}{named or unnamed character vector. Subset, rename, and
reorder coefficient groups specified in the \code{group} argument. See \code{coef_map}.}
    \item{\code{add_rows}}{a data.frame (or tibble) with the same number of columns as
your main table. By default, rows are appended to the bottom of the table.
You can define a "position" attribute of integers to set the row positions.
See Examples section below.}
    \item{\code{align}}{A string with a number of characters equal to the number of columns in
the table (e.g., \code{align = "lcc"}).  Valid characters: l, c, r, S.
\itemize{
\item "l": left-aligned column
\item "c": centered column
\item "r": right-aligned column
\item "d": dot-aligned column. Only supported for LaTeX/PDF tables produced by \code{kableExtra}. These commands must appear in the LaTeX preamble (they are added automatically when compiling Rmarkdown documents to PDF):
\itemize{
\item \verb{\\usepackage{booktabs}}
\item \verb{\\usepackage{siunitx}}
\item \verb{\\newcolumntype{d}{S[input-symbols = ()]}}
}
}}
    \item{\code{title}}{string}
    \item{\code{escape}}{boolean TRUE escapes or substitutes LaTeX/HTML characters which could
prevent the file from compiling/displaying. This setting does not affect captions or notes.}
  }}
