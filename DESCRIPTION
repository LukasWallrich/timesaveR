Description: Functions and templates in this package facilitate common tasks 
    in the course of most research projects in social psychology and related 
    fields. These include creating scales, reporting descriptive statistics,
    correlations and distributions, reporting linear regression models with 
    standardized coefficients and F-change comparisons, as well as plotting 
    mediation models.
